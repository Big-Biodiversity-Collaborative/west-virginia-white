# Want to see how much (prop/perc) of West Virginia White observations overlap 
# with native host plants.

# Load in data

# Determine latitude bands (0-25, 25-50, 50-75, 75-100) or (1/3, 2/3, 3/3)?

# Calculate, for each year, each band 80% envelope (or 10, 90 percentiles)

# Calculate for each year, each band, what proportion of the insect 80% falls 
# within the plants' 80%

# Plot the proportion of insects 80% by year for each latitude band
